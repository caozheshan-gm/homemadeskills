# Skill Encyclopedia Updater

## Overview

Keep `skill百科全书.md` in sync with a skills list from any source.

This workflow does **not** require Codex/superpowers. If you *do* have Codex, the script can optionally include a Codex `use-skill` load line.

## Inputs

- Target encyclopedia note (Obsidian Markdown), default in this vault:
  - `embrace chaos/skill百科全书.md`
- Skills source (pick one):
  - Codex export file (e.g. `AGENTS.md` “Available skills” list)
  - OR a plain text file with one skill name per line (bullets like `- name` / `* name` also work)

## Workflow (fast)

### Step 1: Generate “missing skill” stubs (no file edits)

Run:

```bash
python3 skill-encyclopedia-updater-universal/scripts/generate_missing_entries.py \
  --skills-file "<path-to-skills-list.txt>" \
  --note "embrace chaos/skill百科全书.md"
```

This prints:
- Which skills are missing from the encyclopedia note (based on `### <skill-name>` headings)
- Markdown stubs you can paste in

If you want the generated stubs to include a Codex load line, add:

```bash
  --include-codex-load
```

### Step 2: Paste stubs into the right section

Rules:
- Only touch the encyclopedia note unless the user explicitly asks for more.
- Preserve existing style; add the smallest possible text for each new entry.
- Prefer using the skill’s own `SKILL.md` frontmatter `description` for `- 适用：…` (avoid guessing).

Recommended entry template:

```md
### <skill-name>

- 适用：<from SKILL.md description, or 1 sentence you verify>
- 文档：<path or link>
- 用法：<1–3 bullets, only if you can state them confidently; otherwise leave TODO>
```

### Step 3: Final consistency check

Re-run Step 1. Expected: “No missing skills found.”

Also verify:
- Frontmatter `date:` is today (or remove the field if you don’t want it drifting)
- No duplicate `### <skill>` headings
- Code fences are balanced

## Common pitfalls

- **Wrong name for `.system/*` skills**: if the skill file lives under `.../.system/<name>/SKILL.md`, the encyclopedia heading and `use-skill` name should be `.system/<name>`.
- **Inventing “用法”**: if you didn’t read the skill’s docs, keep it minimal (or leave a TODO).
- **Creating extra plan notes**: don’t add `docs/plans/*` unless explicitly requested.
